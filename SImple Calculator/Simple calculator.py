#Simple Calculator:

#Write a program that takes two integers from the user, 
# performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), 
# and prints the results.

# pseudo code 
#
# 
# Create Two Variables : 
# First Number equate it to the input function and type in brackets("Input the first number")
# Second Number ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////(Same thing)
# Addition=Perform the addition operation
# subtraction = Perform the subtraction eqaution
# Multiplication = perform the multiplication Operation
# Division = perform the division operation
# print All Of it 
# *#
First_Number = int(input("What Is the first number:?  "))
Second_Number = int(input("What is the second Number:? "))
addition = First_Number + Second_Number
subtraction = First_Number - Second_Number
Multiplication = First_Number *  Second_Number
Division = First_Number/Second_Number
print("First_Number + Second_Number is = "  +str(addition))
print("First_Number - Second_Number is = "  +str(subtraction))
print("First_Number * Second_Number is = "  +str(Multiplication))
print("First_Number / Second_Number is = "  +str(Division))
