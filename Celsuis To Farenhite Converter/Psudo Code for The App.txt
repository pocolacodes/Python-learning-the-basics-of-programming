The Main Purpose of the App is to Convert Celsius Temperature To Fahrenheit(Vice Versa):

Note : VERY IMPORTANT PLEASE READ THIS NEXT LINE

THIS IS FOR DEVELOPERS PLEASE IF YOU ARE A NON TECHNICAL PERSON READ THE SUMMARY NOTE THANK YOU.

So To do this we will need a way to ask the user what kind of temperature he wants.
We can Do This Using An Input Statement:

What_Tempreture_Are_You_Converting_From = input("\nAre You Converting From Celsuis To Farenhite or Farenhite to Celsuis:?      ")

Then We will Also Need an If and elif statement to check whether  it is Celsuis  or Fahrenheit.

if   What_Tempreture_Are_You_Converting_From == "Celsuis" :

under the if statement we will need a function that collects the Celsius input Converts It to Fahrenheit:

def Celsuis_to_Farenhite():

so under the function we will have an input function that collects the number 
in string then we type cast it to int:

Celsuis = int(input("\nType Your Tempreture In Celsuis:?(`C)  "))

Now This Variable Is to convert it from Celsuis to Farenhite :

Celsuis_to_Farenhite =  (Celsuis * 1.8) + 32

The Farenhite Value is displayed using this Line 
print(str(Celsuis_to_Fahrenhite)+"`F")

Now for the function to operate we use this function.

Now We do the same thing for the Fahrenheit temp

But this time we create an elif statement to check for the Fahrenheit:
 
elif What_Tempreture_Are_You_Converting_From =="Fahrenheit" :

create a function that converts from Fahrenheit to Celsius :

def Fahrehite_to_Celsuis():

Basically just follow the same procedure as the Celsius to Fahrenheit 
except that at the Variable conversion Stage use THE FOEMULAE FOR FARENHITE TO CELSUIS 

WELL THATS Pretty much it, HOPE THIS HELPED
